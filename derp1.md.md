**Orientation to Science Courses**

**Science Learning Center (SLC)**. You can enter this site from the left-hand side navigation bar under Course Content. The SLC houses a set of instructional and support materials of use across the science curriculum. Currently, the SLC houses two items:  
1.  The Scientific Method Tutorial  - This module provides an excellent description of the Scientific Method. This method is integral to all science, and is important for our course.  
2.  The Science Studies Tutorial  - This piece is designed to provide students with some tips and strategies for taking a science course. Some of the strategies in this unit are generic and apply to students' general study habits for all courses. Other segments of the unit are specific to taking a science course. This unit is short and should not take more than 30-40 minutes to complete. I recommend that you read the unit during the first couple of weeks of the semester. **If you have difficulty with science, then the Science Study Skills Unit is a MUST READ.**
**College Writing Essentials**
