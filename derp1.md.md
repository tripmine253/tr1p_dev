**Orientation to Science Courses**

**Science Learning Center (SLC)**. You can enter this site from the left-hand side navigation bar under Course Content. The SLC houses a set of instructional and support materials of use across the science curriculum. Currently, the SLC houses two items:  
1.  The Scientific Method Tutorial  - This module provides an excellent description of the Scientific Method. This method is integral to all science, and is important for our course.  
2.  The Science Studies Tutorial  - This piece is designed to provide students with some tips and strategies for taking a science course. Some of the strategies in this unit are generic and apply to students' general study habits for all courses. Other segments of the unit are specific to taking a science course. This unit is short and should not take more than 30-40 minutes to complete. I recommend that you read the unit during the first couple of weeks of the semester. **If you have difficulty with science, then the Science Study Skills Unit is a MUST READ.**
**College Writing Essentials**

-   Majority of content is written in the studentâ€™s own words, and directly quoted content is limited to less than 10% of total content
-   Introduction previews the main points, and conclusion summarizes main points
-   Ideas are presented clearly, follow sound logic, and flow coherently and cohesively
-   Content is expressed using standard grammar, punctuation and spelling conventions
-   Paragraph content reflects reasonable transitions
-   Content reflects synthesis and critical analysis of referenced sources
-   Ideas are supported by referenced evidence, and full citations are provided for all reference sources
**Summing Up a Successful Online Student**. An online course places more responsibility on the student (and subsequently more independence) than a face-to-face course. Therefore, **a successful online student must exercise more self-discipline than a face-to-face student**. A successful online student is one who:

-   reads the Course Schedule's assigned reading material thoroughly before responding in a discussion
-   prepares personal study notes (like classroom notes) each week from the reading assignment addressing key points, key figures, and defines any bold-faced terms
-   considers outlining the course material for personal study
-   participates two-to-three times per week in discussion and avoids late week discussion comments
-   engages the material and others with enthusiasm and courtesy
-   schedules adequate time to do the work
-   asks for help when needed
-   interacts with others in the class
-   is self-motivated
-   turns in well-drafted, proofed, and properly cited and referenced assignments prior to their due dates
-   keeps copies o**Assignment**
