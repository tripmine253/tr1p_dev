## Question 1. 
#### Does the writer introduce the instructions adequately?
> Moderate fluff used regarding the cost and overall quality of product albeit irrelevant because of the following:
 - It's been purchased already.
 - The material is pretty standard, even for more expensive models.
 - Has no direct bearing on the assembly process.
 - Could possibly justify the reason for it being not assembled in prior to transit for the sake of it preventing damage.

#### Does the reader understand, from the instructions,  why he or she would want to read these instructions?
The overall tone and intent of the instructions clearly define the objective, placing emphasis on the assumed skill level of reader as a cellist.

 The reader is expected to take the following away from the instructions:
-  Preparation steps advising adequate space.
-	Identification of component placements in the unpacking phase. 
-	Components of the cello are identified by individual part names

## Question 2
