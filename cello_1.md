Question 1. 
 - Does the writer introduce the instructions adequately?
> Moderate fluff used regarding the cost and overall quality of product albeit irrelevant because of the following:
 - It's been purchased already.
 - The material is pretty standard, even for more expensive models.
 - Has no direct bearing on the construction.
 - Could possibly justify the reason for it being not assembled in prior to transit for the sake of it preventing damage.
 - Does the reader understand, from the instructions,  why he or she would want to read these instructions?

	 The reader is expected to take the following away from the instructions:
	-  Preparation steps advising adequate space.
	-	Identification of component placements in the unpacking phase. 
	-	Components of the cello are identified by individual part names
