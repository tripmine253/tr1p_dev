-   Read the **Class Announcements**. This is where your instructor will post any instructions, so pay attention to these before you dive into the discussions.
-   Print your **syllabi**. The syllabus will detail the structure of your course and the instructor's expectations and provide his or her contact information.
-   Participate in your first **discussion** and introduce yourself to your fellow classmates. This is how you'll get to know each other.
### Two or More Weeks Before Class

-   Set up your study space—an area dedicated just for coursework.
-   Create a folder on your desktop and in your e-mail. Keep all messages and files related to your course in one place that's easy to find.
-   Identify a strategy for backing up important files (flash drive, e-mail, cloud/Google docs).
